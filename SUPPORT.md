1. The user must have MSVC C++ as well install boost libraries. Here is the link to boost and visual studio 2017. But the user should install the lastest version of their respected software 
https://www.badprog.com/c-boost-setting-up-on-windows-10
2. If the user wants to use other C++ editors then the user should also install and link omp seperately as well as text editors that supports msvc compiler for C++

3. Once you are done, with either or both steps,clone the respository with the provided link above.
4. Start the application by running the .exe file or clicking "start without debugging in C++" in microsoft visual studio code 
5. If the user wants to put in multiple  set of option parameter inputs, then the user has to modify the "input.csv" files provided in the project directly. From there you will be able to modify the parameter of your option prices
6. The user can instead opt to type all the parameters of the option price by console instead.
7. The user will first be prompted to choose between the random number generator type, finite difference method type and the the model for the stochastic differential equation. The user will also have to specify the number of time steps and number of subdivisions. Note that larger subdivision and time steps lead to slower computation times.
8. If the user wants to type in the input for a single set of option parameter than the user be prompted to do so
9. The simulation wil begin after the user has done steps 4-8. If the user put their inputs inside the "input.csv" the the output will be  printed out on  "Output.csv".
10. The option prices and simulation number will printed for convience.
